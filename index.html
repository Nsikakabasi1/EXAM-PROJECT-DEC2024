        <h3> Project description </h3>
        <Ul>
          <Li>
            Creating a prototype for a web application involves designing a preliminary version of the app to visualize its features,
            user interface, and flow.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            This can be done through wireframes, mockups, or interactive prototypes using tools like Figma,
            Sketch, or Adobe XD.
          </Li>
          <Li>
            The goal is to provide a clear representation of the app’s structure, allowing for user feedback and
             iterations before development.
          </Li>
          <li>
            Prototyping helps identify potential issues, improve usability, 
            and ensure that the final product aligns with user needs and business objectives..
